				1. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.2. My Mum tries to be cool by saying that she likes all the same things that I do.3. If the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy had babies would they take your teeth and leave chocolate for you?4. A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.5. What was the person thinking  when they discovered cow’s milk was fine for human consumption… and why did they do it in the first place!?6. Last Friday in three week’s time I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.7. Wednesday is hump day, but has anyone asked the camel if he’s happy about it?8. If Purple People Eaters are real… where do they find purple people to eat?</p>
